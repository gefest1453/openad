This version of OpenAnalysis is a snapshot that 
works with OpenAD (see www.mcs.anl.gov/openad).
The subversion repository at Rice University is 
serving only as means to allow incremental updates to
and incremental builds of an OpenAD installation.  
To obtain the complete revision history 
for the OpenAnalysis development and the most 
recent code (that is not necessarily working 
with OpenAD) refer to the OpenAnalysis web page
