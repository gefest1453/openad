This is the README for the version of Xerces-C++ that is distributed
with HPCToolkit.  HPCToolkit uses Xerces-C++ to parse XML data files.

This directory contains a complete version of Xerces-C++ that has been
tested with HPCToolkit.  Also, we have added a top level makefile to
simplify the building process when used with HPCToolkit.

It is not strictly necessary to use this version of Xerces, but we do
not currently support other situations.  Consequently, we strongly
encourage the use of this version of Xerces-C++ with HPCToolkit.

For further information on Xerces-C++, see

Some files have been very slightly modified (originals exist as *.ORIG).
